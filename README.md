# calc-cli

A simple command-line calculator.
# about it
 i made it for learning c++ and its my first real  fineshed project 
 the code is sloppy but i will do better next time ..i hope
 
## 🗺️Roadmap
- adding more functions
- make it support for unlimited arguments in some func (e.g., calc -p 1 2 3 4 5)
- making tui
- saving answer and reuse it
